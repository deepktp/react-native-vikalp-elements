### Step 1: Say Goodbye to the Old, Hello to the New

Choose your preferred package manager to replace the legacy library with Vikalp Elements.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

#### Purge the Old Guard

```bash
npm uninstall @rneui/base @rneui/themed
```

#### Welcome Vikalp Elements

```bash
npm install @rn-vui/base @rn-vui/themed
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

#### Remove the Unmaintained Packages

```bash
yarn remove @rneui/base @rneui/themed
```

#### Install the Revitalized Library

```bash
yarn add @rn-vui/base @rn-vui/themed
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

### Step 2: Update Your Imports - Two Paths to Victory

You have two convenient options for updating your import statements to reflect the new library name.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="manual" label="Option 1: The Manual Sweep" default>

This method involves a direct find and replace in your project files. Locate all instances of `@rneui` and replace them with `@rn-vui`. This ensures your application points to the newly installed library.

**Example with the `Button` Component:**

```diff
-// Before
-import { Button } from '@rneui/themed';

+// After
+import { Button } from '@rn-vui/themed';
```

Carefully review your entire codebase to ensure every import statement referencing components from the old library is updated.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="build-tools" label="Option 2: Automate with Build Tools">

For a more automated approach, you can configure your build tools to handle the import replacement during the build process.

#### Install `babel-plugin-module-resolver`

Use the appropriate command for your package manager:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```bash
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-module-resolver
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add --dev babel-plugin-module-resolver
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Configure Babel

Modify your `babel.config.js` file to include an alias that redirects `@rneui` imports to `@rn-vui`:

```diff
  module.exports = {
-   presets: ['module:@react-native/babel-preset'],

+   presets: ['module:@react-native/babel-preset'],
+   plugins: [
+     [
+       'module-resolver',
+       {
+         root: ['.'],
+         alias: {
+           '@rneui': '@rn-vui',
+         },
+       },
+     ],
+   ]
  };
```

#### Configure TypeScript

Update your `tsconfig.json` file to define a path alias for TypeScript to correctly resolve the new module path:

```diff
{
-   "extends": "@react-native/typescript-config/tsconfig.json"


+   "extends": "@react-native/typescript-config/tsconfig.json",
+   "compilerOptions": {
+     "baseUrl": ".",
+     "paths": {
+       "@rneui/*": ["node_modules/@rn-vui/*"]
+     }
+   }
}
```

> **Important**: After making these configuration changes, **restart your Metro server (`npx react-native start --reset-cache` or `yarn start --reset-cache`) and your code editor** to ensure the updates are applied correctly.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Test Drive Your Revitalized Application

With the new library in place and imports updated, it's crucial to thoroughly test your application to ensure a smooth transition. Pay close attention to the following components if they are part of your project:

- **Airbnb Ratings and Ratings Components**: We've made some updates to these components. Please test them to ensure they display and function as expected.
- **Bottom Sheet**: Minor adjustments have been made. Verify that it behaves as intended, including sliding actions and interactions.
- **Tabs and Tab Views**: Check that tab navigation and transitions work smoothly after the migration.

> **Note**: While this migration focuses on renaming and bug fixes without introducing major breaking changes, comprehensive testing of these key components will guarantee a stable and functional application.

### Troubleshooting Common Migration Hiccups

Here are a few common issues you might encounter during the migration and how to address them:

- **"Module not found: @rneui/themed" or "@rneui/base"**: This usually indicates that the old packages were not completely uninstalled, or the new `@rn-vui` packages were not installed correctly. Double-check your `package.json` and the `node_modules` directory. Rerun the installation commands if necessary.
- **Build errors after updating imports**: If you encounter build errors related to module resolution, try clearing your Metro cache (`npx react-native start --reset-cache` or `yarn start --reset-cache`) and restarting your development server and code editor. This forces Metro to re-evaluate the module dependencies.
- **TypeScript errors related to path aliases**: If you are using TypeScript and encounter errors after updating `tsconfig.json`, ensure that the file has been saved correctly and that your editor and TypeScript language server have picked up the changes. Restarting your editor can often resolve these issues.
